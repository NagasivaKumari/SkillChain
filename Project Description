SkillChain is a blockchain-powered learning and recruitment platform designed to revolutionize skill verification and hiring. Like Coursera, it offers courses where users can learn and earn blockchain-verified certificates. The platform integrates NFTs and tokenization, ensuring authenticity, security, and ownership of credentials. Learners receive NFT-based certificates that are tamper-proof and verifiable on the blockchain. Additionally, tokenization incentivizes participation, allowing users to earn and trade tokens for completing courses or contributing to the ecosystem. Recruiters can leverage these blockchain-verified credentials to find and hire skilled professionals with proven expertise, creating a transparent and trust-based hiring process.
